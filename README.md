# datsync
        Script project for syncing files locally in linux
### A script that syncs files one way, either to your local machine to local usb or android device, or vice-versa
simply do:
datsync '-push android' or '-pull android', or 'usb' for removable device,
and this will sync all files in the local directory to the target android/usb directory or vice versa respectively. 
Note that It still won't delete files on the target that is not in the source directory, 
use mirror-push or mirror-pull for that and do it at your own risk. (peace)

I'm too lazy to make readme. 
I'll soon update this for more clear usage and instructions, hopefully.
