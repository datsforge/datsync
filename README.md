# datsync

**datsync** is a lightweight Bash tool for syncing data between your local machine and external devices ‚Äî specifically Android devices (via ADB) and USB drives ‚Äî with optional mirroring and persistent configuration.

> üîß Because backups should be simple, fast, and smarter than your average sync script.

## ‚ú® Features

- Push/pull files between **local ‚Üî Android/USB**
- Supports both Android **internal** (`/sdcard/`) and **external** (`/storage/`) storage
- **Mirror mode**: deletes files not present in the source (careful now)
- Supports **short options**: `-an` (android-internal), `-ax` (android-external)
- **Persistent config** ‚Äì remembers your paths and preferences
- Designed for **Linux**

## üì¶ Installation

Just drop it somewhere in your `PATH`:



```bash
chmod +x datsync.sh
mv datsync.sh datsync        # Remove .sh extension
sudo mv datsync /usr/local/bin/
```

Then run it like:

```bash
datsync --help
```

Also configure the target path as you like, defaults are :
- LOCAL_PATH="$HOME/backups/sync/local"
- OUT_PATH="/backups/sync/local"

```bash
datsync --configure
```

## üß™ Example Usage

Push to Android internal:
```bash
datsync push -android internal
```

Pull from Android external:
```bash
datsync pull -android external
# or the short way:
datsync pull -ax
```

Mirror push to USB (deletes files on USB not in local):
```bash
datsync push-m -usb
```

Mirror pull from Android internal:
```bash
datsync pull-m -an
```

Prompt for storage if not specified:
```bash
datsync push -android
```

Override local path for this operation only:
```bash
datsync push -usb -l /home/user/projects/backups
```
